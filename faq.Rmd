### Q: What if I do not yet consider myself to be a Christian? 

As long as you have are intellectually charitable and want to learn, you are welcome to join the study. 

### Q: Will the work I do in the workbook be shared with others?

Although the class meetings will have some time for discussion, no sharing is compulsory. Nothing you do in the workbook will be turned in; the workbook is meant for your personal reflection only.
