## Bible study materials 

These are some resources you might find helpful as you study the Bible; all of them are free: 

  - [Matthew Henry's Commentary](https://www.biblestudytools.com/commentaries/matthew-henry-complete/) --- has details and reflections on each chapter of Bible
  
  - [Parallel Bible](https://www.wordproject.org/bibles/parallel/o/chinese.htm) is a tool for reading English side by side with other languages
  
  - [A searchable online Bible](https://www.biblegateway.com/) - great for comparing different translations. 
  
  - [Blue letter Bible](https://www.blueletterbible.org/) is a resource that you can use for studying the original text (e.g., the Greek words in a specific New Testament verse). This app will also help you find all the places in the Bible where a specific word is used, so you can study that word's meaning within the full context of Scripture.
