# Welcome!

This is the landing page for the 2023 summer Bible study course called "Behold Your God." This 13-week course was written and designed by the leaders of [Media Gratie](https://www.mediagratiae.org/behold-your-god-rethinking-god-biblically). This study is being offered as a virtual course during summer 2023 through [Grace Community Church Downtown](https://graceb3.org/downtown-campus/) in Iowa City. 

The treasure of the Christian life is knowing God, and the objective of this class is for students to know Him and His character.
